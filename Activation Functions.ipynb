Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become very small during backpropagation, causing the network to learn very slowly. Exploding gradients, on the other hand, occur when gradients become exceptionally large, leading to unstable training.

The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients in the early layers of a deep network become extremely small during backpropagation, making it difficult for the network to learn and update the weights in the earlier layers effectively. This often happens with traditional ReLU activation when the input is negative because the derivative of ReLU is 0 for negative inputs.\n",

Like sigmoid, tanh is also susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem for very large or very small input values. However, its output range centered around 0 makes it sometimes preferred over sigmoid in certain situations, especially in the hidden layers of neural networks."
